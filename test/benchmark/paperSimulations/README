== Simulations ==

The set of simulations are:
{One,Many}{Human,Staph}{Error,NoError}Reads{100,250}

'Many' sample simulations are all done with sequencing error

1. Genomes:
hg19 chr1 is used for human (249Mbp)
Strain TW20 circular chromosome is used for Staph (3Mbp)
2. Samples:
Many is 10 for Human 1,000 for Staph
3. Read Length:
Reads are 100 or 250 bp long
4. Insert Size:
insert gap size is Normally distributed with mean 250, stddev 50: N(250,50)
5. Covg:
Covg is 30X for human, 100X for staph
6. Sequencing error:
Error is empirical from PhiX Illumina reads
7. Variation:
Pi is 1/1000bp in human, 1/100bp staph
Allele frequency has distribution 1/N
8. Variant Calling
Calling is with k=31
Using released cortex, shades, paths (se,pe,se+pe)
