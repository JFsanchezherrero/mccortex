Cortex with low memory and read-threading
=========================================

Isaac Turner's experimental fork of cortex_var, to handle larger populations
with better assembly.

Build
-----

Compiles with clang and gcc. Tested on Mac OS X and linux. 
The first compile will take a while since the libraries in libs/ need to be
downloaded and installed.

    cd libs; make; cd ..

To compile for one sample and maximum kmer size of 31:

    make

to compile for ten samples and maximum kmer size of 63:

    make NUM_COLS=10 MAXK=63

Requires zlib to be installed.  Also relies on multiple other libraries but
these are all downloaded into libs/ and compiled.
