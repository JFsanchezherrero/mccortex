Cortex with low memory and read-threading
=========================================

De novo assembly and variant calling using de bruijn graphs. Variant calling
with and without a reference genome. Between closely related samples or highly
diverged ones. From bacterial to mammalian genomes. Minimal configuration.
And it's free.

Isaac Turner's experimental fork of cortex_var, to handle larger populations
with better genome assembly.

Build
-----

Compiles with clang and gcc. Tested on Mac OS X and linux. Requires zlib.
The first compile will take a while since the libraries in libs/ need to be
downloaded and compiled.

    cd libs; make; cd ..

To compile for a maximum kmer size of 31:

    make

to compile for a maximum kmer size of 63:

    make MAXK=63

Commands
--------

ctx_build    [FASTA/FASTQ/BAM -> binary file]
ctx_thread   [thread reads through cleaned population]
ctp_view     [view read threading information]
ctx_call     [call variants]
ctx_unique   [remove duplicated bubbles -> VCF]
ctx_place    [place variants and genotype]
ctx_subgraph [filter a subgraph]
ctx_reads    [filter reads using a graph]

Common Pipelines
----------------

Example pipelines -here- shortly:
1. One high depth sample
2. Multiple low depth samples
