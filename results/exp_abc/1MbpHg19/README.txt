chr22.1Mbp.uniq.fa was generated by taking hg19 chr22:17,000,000-17,999,999 and
adding unique kmers (k=31) to the start and end.

Unique kmers added were:
CGACCATAAGTCTTGACAGGCTTTGTTCCCT
GAGCGAGCCAGAACAGGTAGTCTGAGGGAGT

In order to re-run the experiment

1. Manually regenerate chr22.1Mbp.uniq.fa
2. From the mccortex directory run:

    # Fetch libraries needed
    cd libs && make core common && cd..
    # Compile McCortex
    make MAXK=31
    # Run the experiment
    cd results/exp_abc/1MbpHg19
    make

That's it!

On my macbook run time is 40 mins
