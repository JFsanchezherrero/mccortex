# Cortex only compiles and runs cleanly on Linux

Run simulation with k=21 and k=31:

    make K=21 run-mccortex run-cortex >& results/20150428.tues.k21.linux.txt
    make K=31 run-mccortex run-cortex >& results/20150428.tues.k31.linux.txt

Re-run again with read lengths of 150bp:

    make K=21 run-mccortex run-cortex >& results/20150429.wed.k21.linux.txt
    make K=31 run-mccortex run-cortex >& results/20150429.wed.k31.linux.txt

Clean with:

    make clean K=21
    make clean K=31
